It is a simple REST API project.

I used tools, frameworks and protocols such as Spring, JPA, JQuery.

Project is written in Java language.

You can run SchoolTrackingApp.java and try the endpoints at Swagger UI on localhost.

Not all endpoints are completed, so you may encounter similar endpoints.
